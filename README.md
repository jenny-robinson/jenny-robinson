My fascination with technology began through music. I was always interested in how music could be created and manipulated using various hardware and software. This has led me to explore how other things are created, including software. I am excited and eager to grow in the ever-growing technology sector and utilise my technical knowledge, creative thinking and curiosity. 

Iâ€™m currently completing a Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev.
